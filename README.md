# CNS2 (in development)
 
 Aims for CNS2
 
 1) fully based on SPM12 and MATLAB, therefore cross-platform
 2) new segmentation and WMH classification algorithms
 3) more user-friendly
 

 ##**Image segmentation algorithms**

 In order to get rid of FSL FAST and fully using MATLAB and SPM, two image segmentation algorithms have been implemented in UBO Detector in CNS2.

 1)
